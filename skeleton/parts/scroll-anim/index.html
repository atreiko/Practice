                The endoskeletons of echinoderms and some other soft-bodied invertebrates 
                such as jellyfish and earthworms are also termed hydrostatic; a body cavity 
                the coelom is filled with coelomic fluid and the pressure from this fluid acts 
                together with the surrounding muscles to change the organism's shape and produce movement

            <li class="text active">
                The skeleton of sponges consists of microscopic calcareous or silicious spicules. 
                The demosponges include 90% of all species of sponges. Their "skeletons" are made of 
                spicules consisting of fibers of the protein spongin, the mineral silica, or both. Where 
                spicules of silica are present, they have a different shape from those in the otherwise similar 
                glass sponges.[6]

            <li class="list__title" data-show="show">Echinoderms</li>
            <li class="text">
                The skeleton of the echinoderms, which include, among other things, the starfish, is composed 
                of calcite and a small amount of magnesium oxide. It lies below the epidermis in the mesoderm and 
                is within cell clusters of frame-forming cells. This structure formed is porous and therefore firm 
                and at the same time light. It coalesces into small calcareous ossicles (bony plates), which can grow 
                in all directions and thus can replace the loss of a body part. Connected by joints, the individual 
                skeletal parts can be moved by the muscles.

            <li class="list__title">Vertebrates</li>
            <li class="text">
                In most vertebrates, the main skeletal component is referred to as bone. These bones compose a unique 
                skeletal system for each type of animal. Another important component is cartilage which in mammals is 
                found mainly in the joint areas. In other animals, such as the cartilaginous fishes, which include the 
                sharks, the skeleton is composed entirely of cartilage. The segmental pattern of the skeleton is present 
                in all vertebrates (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians) with basic units being repeated. This 
                segmental pattern is particularly evident in the vertebral column and the ribcage.

            <li class="list__title" data-show="show">Fish</li>
            <li class="text">
                The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish is either made of cartilage as in the 
                (Chondrichthyes), or bones as in the (Osteichthyes). The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, 
                composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there 
                are no limbs or limb girdles. They are supported only by the muscles.
            </li>
            <li class="list__title">Birds</li>
            <li class="text">
                The bird skeleton is highly adapted for flight. It is extremely lightweight, yet still strong enough to 
                withstand the stresses of taking off, flying, and landing. One key adaptation is the fusing of bones into 
                single ossifications, such as the pygostyle. Because of this, birds usually have a smaller number of bones 
                than other terrestrial vertebrates.

            <li class="list__title" data-show="show">Humans</li>
            <li class="text">
                The skeleton consists of both fused and individual bones supported and supplemented by ligaments, tendons, 
                muscles and cartilage. It serves as a scaffold which supports organs, anchors muscles, and protects organs 
                such as the brain, lungs, heart and spinal cord.
